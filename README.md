Predicting the traction power of metropolitan railway lines using different Machine Learning models

Railways are an efficient transport mean with lower energy consumption and emissions in comparison to other transport means for freight and passenger, and yet there is a growing need to increase their efficiency. To achieve this, it is needed to accurately predict their energy consumption, a task which is traditionally carried out using deterministic models which rely on data measured through money- and time-consuming methodologies. In this study, we used collected data related to energy consumption in lines 1, 2, 3 and 5 of MetroValencia (Spain) for predicting the traction power using different Machine Learning models. Using only four basic (and cheap to measure) features (train speed, acceleration, track slope and radius of curvature) we tested six Machine Learning models, and we realised that a Random Forest model is the best Machine Learning model to perform this task obtaining an R-squared coefficient of 0.70 and a rMSE of 22.58%. The most important implication of our results is the possibility of using basic (and cheap to measure) features to predict the traction power in a metropolitan railway line, and the possibility of using this model as a tool to assess different strategies in order to reduce the traction power in metropolitan railway lines.
